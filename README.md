# Window Positioner plugin for Google Chrome
This is the source code for the Window Positioner plugin for the Google Chrome web browser.

It is available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-positioner/cjoidmhkohpfflneoadklkfkekihbjia).

This plugin will launch a set list of windows when Chrome starts, and position them on the screen as desired. Widths and heights for each window can be specified. Additionally, you may specify for a window to be launch in fullscreen mode.

To configure the plugin, navigate to chrome://extensions and click the Options link for Window Positioner (remember to enable the plugin first).
